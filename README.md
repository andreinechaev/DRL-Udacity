# Project 1: Navigation

### Introduction

For this project, you will train an agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.  

![Trained Agent][image1]

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.  Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions.  Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:
- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Getting Started

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the environment.

2. Place the file in the DRLND GitHub repository, in the `p1_navigation/` folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file. 

### Instructions

Follow the instructions in `Navigation.ipynb` to get started with training your own agent!  

### Approach

To solve the environment DQN method was chosen. DQN resembles Q-learning with the difference that Neural Networks are used instead of Q-table.
DQN architecture consists of 2 neural networks:
   - Online network - used for constant learning
   - Target network - used for delayed update and calculation of the Temporal Difference error (TD) using a loss function
 
Both networks use the same architecture and share weight. For the given task a simple linear network with 3 hidden layers was created.
 
```text
   Input
     |
   _/ Linear(128)
     |
   _/ Linear(512)
     |
   _/ Linear(256)
     |
   Output
Where _/ - ReLu
```

Over experimentation it was decided to update the Target network every 10 episodes.
For the Loss 2 functions were considered MSE and L1 Smooth. When the last showed better results through series of runs.

[loss](plots/loss_per_episode.png)

As an optimizer there were inconclusive results between Adam and SGD. It is very likely due to inability to seed random to the environment.
Adam, once, showed good results in just 300 episodes. But after similar results couldn't be achieved.
SGD achieved the goal in less than 1800 episodes.
It is worth noting that SGD shows a smoother incline in performance, when Adam tends to drop unexpectedly.

[reward history](plots/rewards_per_episode.png)

Performance was affected by two main factors. Replay Buffer and Epsilon value.
When the same architecture with a Replay Buffer of size 10000 works well on base gym environment (i.e. CartPole-v1) more complex environments,
such as the one considered here, require a larger buffer to keep the target for the model for longer. The best results were achieved with the buffer of size 50.000.

For the Epsilon decay an exponential decay with a long tail was chosen. It is motivated by the longevity of episodes.

[epsilon decay](plots/eps_decay.png)

Slower Epsilon decay serves like a good regularization. Therefore helps to prevent overfitting by adding distributed noise to data.

To achieve the best result early stop was used. Parametrized by the GOAL+2 over at least 15 consecutive episodes.

### (Optional) Challenge: Learning from Pixels

After you have successfully completed the project, if you're looking for an additional challenge, you have come to the right place!  In the project, your agent learned from information such as its velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around its forward direction.  A more challenging task would be to learn directly from pixels!

To solve this harder task, you'll need to download a new Unity environment.  This environment is almost identical to the project environment, where the only difference is that the state is an 84 x 84 RGB image, corresponding to the agent's first-person view.  (**Note**: Udacity students should not submit a project with this new environment.)

You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
- Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/VisualBanana_Linux.zip)
- Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/VisualBanana.app.zip)
- Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/VisualBanana_Windows_x86.zip)
- Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/VisualBanana_Windows_x86_64.zip)

Then, place the file in the `p1_navigation/` folder in the DRLND GitHub repository, and unzip (or decompress) the file.  Next, open `Navigation_Pixels.ipynb` and follow the instructions to learn how to use the Python API to control the agent.

(_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS, you must follow the instructions to [set up X Server](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md), and then download the environment for the **Linux** operating system above.
